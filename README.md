Release Notes :-


    1. I have created this project in swift language. I can also create this on Objective-C also.
    2. For User List screen and Core data I have used Objective-C.
    3. For User Details Screen I have used swift.
    4. I have managed the brach structure. If you provided me any task with ID then I can create brach with that task ID.
    5. As you know currenty swift language is more used rather then Objective C so I am able manage this code in more better way in Swift.
    6. I have implemented Pagination for User List Screen. 
    7. I have also managed .gitignore and README for this demo.
